1.objetive of the project:

The Student Grades and Performance Tracker is a desktop-based Java application developed with the primary objective of simplifying and streamlining the 
process of managing student academic records. This system enables users—such as teachers, administrators, or coordinators—to enter, store, 
and manage essential student information including ID, name, subject, and marks through a user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing. 
It ensures that data is organized and maintained efficiently in a MySQL database using JDBC for seamless connectivity. A core feature of the application is its ability to compute a student's 
CGPA dynamically based on the entered marks and determine their placement eligibility, thus aiding in academic evaluation and decision-making. The system also provides capabilities to view all records,
delete individual entries, or clear the entire database, offering flexibility and control over data management. Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, this project serves as a practical academic
tool that highlights core database operations, Java GUI design, and real-time data processing, while also providing a foundation for future enhancements such as performance analytics and report generation.
